# How to set up your Discord.JS (d.JS) Bot
This tutorial is assuming that you have already set up the bot (Already created it in the Discord Developer Portal and invited it to the server) and are ready to code it.
If you haven't even created the bot yet, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcLspwognk0

## How to install node.js, npm, and Visual Studio Code
Visit: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm and download Node and NPM
Visit: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download Visual Studio Code

## How to install d.JS
Go to your command line and type in:
(Windows 10 & Linux)
```sh
npm install --save discord.js
```

## Coding the Bot
Download this repository (don't forget to leave a star ;)) and open Visual Studio Code

## How to test the bot?
Go to the top of Visual Studio Code after opening the file and press `New Terminal`. Then type in either node index.js or npm start (If it doesn't work, create an issue or DM via Discord @ CadetMercury, but before you DM, make sure you actually have npm and node installed)
If the bot replies in the command line saying "Bot is online" then you are good to go!
Also, type in the Discord you invited the bot to '?ping' and your bot should reply with 'Pong'

## Only a Template...
Remember that this is only a template to get started with your Discord Bot and it doesn't have any ready made commands besides '?ping. If you want a tutorial on how to make commands, visit: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWnw41ah3I4ZfNLV3by7nB6JO2WcCc3Wj
